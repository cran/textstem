Versioning
----------

Releases will be numbered with the following semantic versioning format:

<major>.<minor>.<patch>

And constructed with the following guidelines:

* Breaking backward compatibility bumps the major (and resets the minor
  and patch)
* New additions without breaking backward compatibility bumps the minor
  (and resets the patch)
* Bug fixes and misc changes bumps the patch




textstem 0.1.0 - 0.1.2
----------------------------------------------------------------

BUG FIXES

* `lemmatize_strings` and `stem_strings` would split numbers with decimals
  rather than treating it as a single token.  This issue has been corrected
  (see issue #3).



textstem 0.0.1
----------------------------------------------------------------

This package is  collection of tools that stem and lemmatize text.  Stemming is
a process that removes endings such as suffixes.  Lemmatization is the process
of grouping inflected forms together as a single base form.
